Incident and Event Management (IEM) is a core function of a Security Operations Center (SOC) that involves **detecting, analyzing, and responding** to security incidents and events in an organization. It ensures timely mitigation of threats, minimizing potential damage to systems, data, and operations.

### **Key Concepts**

1. **Event**
    
    - Any observable occurrence in a system or network.
        
    - Example: Login attempt, file access, network connection.
        
    - Events can be **normal**, **informational**, or **anomalous**.

2. **Incident**
    
    - A security event or series of events that **threatens the confidentiality, integrity, or availability** (CIA) of an organization’s assets.
        
    - Example: Malware infection, unauthorized access, data breach.
        
    - Incidents require **immediate attention and response**.

### **Objectives of IEM**

- Detect security threats early.
    
- Respond to incidents effectively to minimize impact.
    
- Maintain logs for forensic investigation and compliance.
    
- Improve organizational security posture through analysis.
    

### **Process of Incident and Event Management**

1. **Event Collection**
    
    - Gathering security events from multiple sources (firewalls, IDS/IPS, servers, endpoints, applications).
        
2. **Event Correlation and Analysis**
    
    - Identifying patterns or anomalies to detect potential security incidents.
        
3. **Incident Detection**
    
    - Determining whether an event or set of events constitutes a security incident.
        
4. **Prioritization**
    
    - Assessing the severity and impact of incidents.
        
5. **Response**
    
    - Containing, mitigating, and eradicating threats.
        
6. **Investigation and Documentation**
    
    - Logging incident details for future analysis, compliance, and lessons learned.
        
7. **Closure and Review**
    
    - Finalizing the incident, implementing improvements, and updating response procedures.
        
### **Detection Outcomes**

### **Tools Used in IEM**

- **SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)**: Splunk, IBM QRadar, ArcSight
    
- **IDS/IPS**: Snort, Suricata
    
- **Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR)**: CrowdStrike, Carbon Black
    
- **Log Management Tools**: ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
    

### **Benefits**

- Rapid detection and response to security incidents.
    
- Reduces potential business impact of cyber threats.
    
- Centralizes monitoring of all security events.
    
- Supports compliance and regulatory requirements.
