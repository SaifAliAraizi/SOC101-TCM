Threats are potential sources of harm to an organization’s information systems, while attacks are deliberate actions by threat actors to exploit vulnerabilities. Understanding common threats and attacks is critical for SOC analysts to detect, prevent, and respond effectively.

### 1. **Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)**

**Definition:**  
Long-term, targeted attacks by sophisticated threat actors, usually with political, financial, or espionage motives.  
**Characteristics:**

- Stealthy and persistent presence in target networks.
    
- Use multiple attack vectors (phishing, malware, exploits).
    
- Often state-sponsored or organized crime groups.
    

**Examples / References:**

- CrowdStrike APT Groups: [CrowdStrike APT](https://crowdstrike.com/adversaries/)
    
- Mandiant APT Insights: [Mandiant APT](https://mandiant.com/resources/insights/apt-groups)

### 2. **Malware Attacks**

**Definition:** Malicious software designed to damage or gain unauthorized access to systems.  
**Types:**

- Virus: Self-replicating code that spreads through files.
    
- Worm: Spreads automatically across networks.
    
- Trojan: Disguised as legitimate software.
    
- Ransomware: Encrypts data and demands ransom.
    
- Spyware / Keyloggers: Steals sensitive information.

### 3. **Phishing & Social Engineering**

**Definition:** Attacks targeting human weaknesses to steal credentials or deploy malware.  
**Types:**

- Email phishing: Fraudulent emails trick users into revealing information.
    
- Spear phishing: Targeted attack on specific individuals or organizations.
    
- Vishing / Smishing: Voice or SMS-based phishing attacks.
    

---

### 4. **Denial of Service (DoS) & Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)**

**Definition:** Attacks aimed at making a service or network unavailable by overwhelming it with traffic.  
**Types:**

- DoS: Single system floods target with requests.
    
- DDoS: Multiple systems (botnets) overwhelm the target simultaneously.
    

---

### 5. **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks**

**Definition:** Intercepting and possibly altering communications between two parties without their knowledge.  
**Examples:**

- Eavesdropping on unencrypted network traffic.
    
- Session hijacking.
    

---

### 6. **SQL Injection & Web Application Attacks**

**Definition:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in web applications to access or manipulate databases.  
**Examples:**

- SQL Injection: Injecting malicious SQL queries.
    
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Injecting malicious scripts into web pages.
    
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): Forcing users to execute unwanted actions.
    

---

### 7. **Insider Threats**

**Definition:** Malicious or accidental actions by trusted personnel that compromise security.  
**Examples:**

- Data theft by employees.
    
- Misuse of credentials.
    
- Negligent behavior causing breaches.
    

---

### Key Points for SOC Analysts:

- Understand the **TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures)** of threats.
    
- Use **MITRE ATT&CK framework** to map attacks and improve detection.
    
- Monitor for **indicators of compromise (IOCs)** and unusual behavior.
    
- Prioritize threats based on **impact, likelihood, and critical assets**.
