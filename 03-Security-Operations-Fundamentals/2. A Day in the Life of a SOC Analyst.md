## **1. Overview**

A **SOC Analyst** is responsible for monitoring, detecting, and responding to cybersecurity incidents on a daily basis. Their work ensures the **security, availability, and integrity** of an organization’s IT infrastructure. The day-to-day tasks can vary depending on the organization’s size, threat landscape, and shift schedules (24/7 SOCs often work in shifts).

## **2. Typical Daily Workflow**

### **Morning / Start of Shift**

- **Check system dashboards and alerts**: Review SIEM dashboards, endpoint logs, and IDS/IPS alerts.
    
- **Incident triage**: Prioritize new alerts based on severity and potential impact.
    
- **Shift handover**: Review unresolved incidents from the previous shift.
    
- **Update threat intelligence**: Check for new vulnerabilities, malware, or attack patterns reported overnight.
    

### **During the Day**

- **Alert analysis**: Investigate suspicious activities (unusual login attempts, malware detection, network anomalies).
    
- **Incident response**: Contain and mitigate threats, such as isolating compromised systems or blocking malicious IP addresses.
    
- **Collaboration**: Communicate with IT, network teams, or management for incident escalation.
    
- **Documentation**: Log all findings, steps taken, and incident reports in the ticketing system.
    
- **Vulnerability scanning**: Run routine scans to identify weaknesses in the network or systems.
    

### **End of Shift / Reporting**

- **Prepare shift reports**: Summarize incidents, actions taken, and pending investigations.
    
- **Handover**: Brief the next shift about ongoing incidents and updates.
    
- **Review metrics**: Monitor SOC KPIs (Mean Time to Detect, Mean Time to Respond, etc.) for performance evaluation.

## **4. Challenges Faced**

- High volume of alerts → risk of alert fatigue.
    
- Handling **false positives** without delaying response to real threats.
    
- Continuous **learning** of new attack techniques and vulnerabilities.
    
- Working in shifts (nights and weekends) in a 24/7 SOC environment.
